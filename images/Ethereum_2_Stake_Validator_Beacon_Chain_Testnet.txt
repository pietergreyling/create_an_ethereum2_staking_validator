Local Development Ethereum 2 Stake Validator -> Validator Keys: Generate validator keys
Local Development Ethereum 2 Stake Validator -> Deposit Contract: Deposit ETH
Local Development Ethereum 2 Stake Validator -> Beacon Node: Start Beacon Node
Local Development Ethereum 2 Stake Validator -> Geth (Client): Start Geth (Client)
Beacon Node -> Ethereum Testnet: Connect to Ethereum Testnet
Geth (Client) -> Testnet Beacon Chain: Connect to Testnet Beacon Chain

[Note over Beacon Node and Geth (Client)]
Both nodes are now connected to the Ethereum 2 Testnet and the Testnet Beacon Chain

Local Development Ethereum 2 Stake Validator -> Beacon Node: Begin validating blocks
Beacon Node -> Local Development Ethereum 2 Stake Validator: Report block validation results
Local Development Ethereum 2 Stake Validator -> Geth (Client): Report block validation results
Geth (Client) -> Testnet Beacon Chain: Report block validation results
Testnet Beacon Chain -> Local Development Ethereum 2 Stake Validator: Distribute rewards

[Note over Local Development Ethereum 2 Stake Validator]
Local Development Ethereum 2 Stake Validator has now earned rewards for validating blocks
